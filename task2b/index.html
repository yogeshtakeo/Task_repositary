Task 2:
Create a webpage that displays a list of items using CSS Flexbox and Grid.

Here are the steps to follow:

Choose a topic for your webpage and create a list of items related to that topic.
Use CSS Flexbox to create a header section with a logo or a title.
Use CSS Grid to create a main content area with a grid of cells.
Add an item to each cell, including an image and some text describing the item.
Use CSS Flexbox to center the images and align the text within each cell.
Apply some basic styling to the layout and the items to make the page visually appealing.
Add hover effects to the cells, such as changing the background color or adding a border, when the user hovers over them.
Add a footer section with some copyright information or contact details. -->
