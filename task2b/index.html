          <h2>Barbell bench press</h2>
          <p>
            The barbell bench press is a push-type compound exercise that
            primarily activates the musculature of the upper body to a
            significant intensity, where it is usually performed for the
            purposes of developing muscle mass and strength through the use of
            resistance induced training stimulus

          <h2>Barbell Squats</h2>
          <p>
            They strengthen your lower body, targeting your glutes and
            quadriceps. They also make you use your core muscles.

          <h2>Barbell Deadlifts</h2>
          <p>
            The deadlift is a hip-dominant movement that works the glutes,
            hamstrings, core, back, and trapezius muscles. Because they work so
            many different muscle groups, deadlifts are an effective exercise to
            incorporate into a workout routine

          <h2>Pullups</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to working your back, pull-ups strengthen and sculpt
            your shoulders, forearms, and chest (pecs). When properly performed,
            they also engage your abs, including your deep transverse abdominis,
            making them a great exercise for targeting many of the major muscles
            in the body.

          <h2>Overhead press</h2>
          <p>
            Overhead pressing can increase: strength and size of the shoulder
            muscles. strength and size of the triceps muscles. strength and size
            of the trapezius muscle

          <h2>The Romanian deadlift</h2>
          <p>
            The Romanian deadlift (RDL) is a traditional barbell lift used to
            develop the strength of the posterior chain muscles, including the
            erector spinae, gluteus maximus, hamstrings and adductors. When done
            correctly, the RDL is an effective exercise that helps strengthen
            both the core and the lower body with one move.
