      This is my first webpage in the bootcamp. So far I am enjoying the class.
      The image shows an example of generic webpage. I didn't realize it was so
      easy to copy repos and work on them in vs code.

      <b>1.Secure Internet Connection:</b> A secure https connections are far
      more secure than the traditional http connections. A threat actor can
      easily gain access to your system an cause a serious damage.<br />
      <b>2. Applications must be uptodate:</b> A vulnerable version of a sofware
      can cause a very serious issue. There are list of CVE's available online
      with the payload required to take control of the vulnerable system. <br />
      <b>3. Safe coding practices:</b> Another way as a developer we can make
      our cyberspace secure is by implementing the best practices and writing
      secure code, making sure vulnerabilities like cross site scripting do not
      take place.
